Activate yeast.

In large bowl, mix together activated yeast, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 1 cup of the flour.

Mix for a few minutes at low speed.

Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until dough no longer sticks to the bowl.

Knead by hand for 5 minutes until smooth and elastic.

Prove until doubled, about an hour.

Gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Shape as desired.

Cover with cloth and prove again until doubled, about 40 minutes.

Heat oil to 350 F.

Slide doughnuts into hot oil using a wide spatula.

Turn over as they rise to the surface. Fry each side until golden brown.

Drain and cool on wire rack.

Melt the butter in a saucepan, incorporate sifted powdered sugar and vanilla.
