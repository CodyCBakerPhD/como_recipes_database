## Ingredients

375/2 g. butter, room temperature

375/2 g. sugar

3  beaten eggs, room temperature

187 grams cake flour

1  tsp baking powder

25 ml. milk

1  tsp vanilla extract



## Instructions

Preheat to 350 F.

Cream butter and sugar with wooden spoon, then set in stand mixer on medium-high for about two minutes, constantly scraping the sides.

Then begin adding very small drizzle of the egg into the butter mixture while it remains in the stand mixer on medium-high. Continue until all egg is incorporated.

Now remove from stand mixer and over the course of several gentle folds, sift and incorporate the flour and baking powder.

Halfway through the folding, add half the milk/vanilla mixture. Add remaining at the end.

Bake for around 20 minutes.
