## Ingredients

180 grams flour

80 grams dark brown sugar

2 grams baking soda

4 grams cinnamon

5/2 grams ginger

1/2 grams cloves

3/2 grams salt

85 grams butter

125 grams molasses

15 grams whole milk



## Notes

Refrigeration is mandatory or the dough will be too sticky to handle

Be wary of overbaking as the darker color makes it difficult to tell.One way to tell baking point is when cookie barely retains an imprint when touched gently with fingertip.



## Instructions

### Dough

Add flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and salt to a mixing bowl and mix.

Cut the butter into pieces and add to bowl, mixing until the mixture resembles fine meal.

With mixer running on low speed gradually add the molasses and milk and mix until combined, about 30 seconds.

Divide the dough in half, forming each into a ball.

Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, until firm.

### Baking

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

Remove one dough sheet from the refrigerator and place on a well floured counter.
