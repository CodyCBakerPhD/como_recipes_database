Tags: American, Breakfast, Vegetarian



## Ingredients

5/2 tbsp melted and cooled butter

1 large egg

1/2 cup buttermilk

1/3 tsp vanilla extract

60 grams flour

2/3 tsp baking powder

1/3 tsp baking soda

1/3 tsp sugar

1 grams salt

1 tbsp pearl sugar



## Instructions

Waffle will be best if all ingredients are at room temperature

Heat waffle iron.

In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients. Create a depression for the buttermilk mixture.

Beat the eggs in a large measuring cup until frothy. Add vanilla extract, buttermilk, and cooled melted butter. Beat until well combined.

Pour into the depression and stir quickly but gently with a wooden spoon.

[Experimental]: Gently incorporate pearl sugar.

Use about 1/4 of batter per waffle. Cook until steam stops rising from the iron.
