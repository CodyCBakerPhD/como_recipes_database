Tags: American, Dessert, Vegetarian, Chocolate



## Ingredients

1 cup room-temperature butter

1 cup sugar

1 cup brown sugar

2 large egg

2 tsp vanilla

1 tsp baking soda

2 tsp hot water

360 grams flour

3 grams salt

2 cups high-quality semi-sweet chocolate chips



## Instructions

Oven temperature is 360 F for caramelization stage.

Cream together butter and sugars. Mix in one egg at a time. Add vanilla at the end.

Dissolve baking soda in water and add to mixture. Mix together flour and salt separately, then add to wet mixture. Do not overwork.

The tricky thing is getting the flour right; could be anywhere between 2 1/2 - 4 cups depending on how buttery/firm you want the result to be.

Dough should be light and fluffy but not sticky.

Baking time can also vary around ~12 minutes; watch your first batch carefully and adjust as needed.
